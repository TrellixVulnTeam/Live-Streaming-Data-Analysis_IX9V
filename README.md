# Python

Twitter_Streaming.py constains python code to connect to twitter API and fetch data and
filter. You can save that file to a local disk and update it to HDFS to analyze using pyspark.

Live_Data_to_array.py contains python code to count the number of times a tag appeared.

I have included a tweepy setup guide incase if you find problem with tweepy import.

You need to go to twitter settings to generate access tokens and put them in code inorder to connect and
get the data from twitter API.
